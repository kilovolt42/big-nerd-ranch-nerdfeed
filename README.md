# Nerdfeed

This is my work on the Nerdfeed exercise from Big Nerd Ranch's [iOS Programming](http://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming.html) (4th Edition), Chapter 21.

The Nerdfeed app downloads a feed of upcoming classes from the Big Nerd Ranch website using `NSURLSession`. It displays a list of those classes in a `UITableView` and loads the page for a selected class in a `UIWebView`. This app runs on both iPhone and iPad as a Universal application.
